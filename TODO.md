- Make this into a MediaWiki extension:
  1. Move code into extension format [DONE!]
  2. Load lists from predetermined wiki pages [DONE!]
  3. Load list of "real titles" directly from the wiki's language links?
  4. Spit output back out as a file [DONE!]
  5. Allow passing a page as a GET argument
  6. Add link to editor toolbar, using the above
  7. Add page title, Page ID, revision number & revision date to file
- Maybe: try to mark only the parts of text a translator should touch?
